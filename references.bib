	abstract = {Ocean turbulence contributes to the basal melting and dissolution of ice shelves by transporting heat and salt towards the ice. The meltwater causes a stable salinity stratification to form beneath the ice that suppresses turbulence. Here we use large-eddy simulations motivated by the ice-shelf/ocean boundary layer (ISOBL) to examine the inherently linked processes of turbulence and stratification, and their influence on the melt rate. Our rectangular domain is bounded from above by the ice base where a dynamic melt condition is imposed. By varying the speed of the flow and the ambient temperature, we identify a fully turbulent, well-mixed regime and an intermittently turbulent, strongly stratified regime. The transition between regimes can be characterised by comparing the Obukhov length, which provides a measure of the distance away from the ice base where stratification begins to dominate the flow, to the viscous length scale of the interfacial sublayer. Upper limits on simulated turbulent transfer coefficients are used to predict the transition from fully to intermittently turbulent flow. The predicted melt rate is sensitive to the choice of the heat and salt transfer coefficients and the drag coefficient. For example, when coefficients characteristic of fully-developed turbulence are applied to intermittent flow, the parameterized three-equation model overestimates the basal melt rate by almost a factor of ten. These insights may help to guide when existing parameterisations of ice melt are appropriate for use in regional or large-scale ocean models, and may also have implications for other ice-ocean interactions such as fast ice or drifting ice.},

	abstract = {Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly in recent decades. The faster than projected retreat suggests that free-running large-scale climate models may not be accurately representing some key processes. The small-scale turbulent entrainment of heat from the mixed layer could be one such process. To better understand this mechanism, we model the Arctic Ocean's Canada Basin, which is characterized by a perennial anomalously warm Pacific Summer Water (PSW) layer residing at the base of the mixed layer and a summertime Near-Surface Temperature Maximum (NSTM) within the mixed layer trapping heat from solar radiation. We use large eddy simulation (LES) to investigate heat entrainment for different ice-drift velocities and different initial temperature profiles. The value of LES is that the resolved turbulent fluxes are greater than the subgrid-scale fluxes for most of our parameter space. The results show that the presence of the NSTM enhances heat entrainment from the mixed layer. Additionally there is no PSW heat entrained under the parameter space considered. We propose a scaling law for the ocean-to-ice heat flux which depends on the initial temperature anomaly in the NSTM layer and the ice-drift velocity. A case study of “The Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012” gives a turbulent heat flux from the mixed layer that is approximately 70\% of the total ocean-to-ice heat flux estimated from the PIOMAS model often used for short-term predictions. Present results highlight the need for large-scale climate models to account for the NSTM layer.},

	abstract = {Increased ocean-driven basal melting beneath Antarctic ice shelves causes grounded ice to flow into the ocean at an accelerated rate, with consequences for global sea level. The turbulent transfer of heat through the ice shelf-ocean boundary layer is critical in setting the basal melt rate, yet the processes controlling this transfer are poorly understood and inadequately represented in global climate models. This creates large uncertainties in predictions of future sea-level rise. Using a hot-water drilled access hole, two turbulence instrument clusters (TICs) were deployed 2.5 and 13.5 meters beneath Larsen C Ice Shelf in December 2011. Both instruments returned a year-long record of turbulent velocity fluctuations, providing a unique opportunity to explore the turbulent processes within the ice shelf-ocean boundary layer. Although the scaling between the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate and mean flow speed varies with distance from the ice shelf base, at both TICs the TKE dissipation rate is balanced entirely by the rate of shear production. The freshwater released by basal melting plays no role in the TKE balance. When the upper TIC is within the log-layer, we derive an under-ice drag coefficient of 0.0022 and a roughness length of 0.44 mm, indicating that the ice base is smooth. Finally, we demonstrate that although the canonical three-equation melt rate parameterization can accurately predict the melt rate for this example of smooth ice underlain by a cold, tidally-forced boundary layer, the law of the wall assumption employed by the parameterization does not hold at low flow speeds.},

These are represented in a similarity framework obtained from the concept of local equilibrium in a fully developed turbulent flow. Mean velocity and temperature profiles in both the inner and outer layers are strongly dependent on the thermal stratification, the former suggesting an increase in the thickness of the viscous sublayer with increasing stability. The coefficients of skin friction and heat transfer, on the other hand, decrease with increasing stability.Normalized turbulent intensities, fluxes and their correlation coefficients also vary with buoyancy. In stable conditions, turbulence becomes rapidly suppressed with increasing stability as more and more energy has to be expended in over- coming buoyancy forces. The buoyancy effects are found to be more dominant in the stress budget than in the turbulent energy budget. The horizontal heat flux is much greater than the vertical heat flux and their ratio increases with stability. The ratio of the eddy diffusivities of heat and momentum, on the other hand, decreases with increasing stability. The spectra of velocity and temperature fluctuations indicate no buoyancy subrange, but the wavenumber corresponding to peak energy is found to increase with increasing stability.},

A previously derived minimum-dissipation model is the QR model. This model is based on the invariants of the resolved rate-of-strain tensor and has many desirable properties. It appropriately switches off for laminar and transitional flows, has low computational complexity, and is consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor on isotropic grids. However, the QR model proposed in the literature gives insufficient eddy dissipation. It is demonstrated that this can be corrected by increasing the model constant. The corrected QR model gives good results in simulations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid. On anisotropic grids the QR model is not consistent with the exact sub-filter tensor and requires an approximation of the filter width. It is demonstrated that the results of the QR model on anisotropic grids are primarily determined by the used filter width approximation, and that no approximation gives satisfactory results in simulations of both a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow. A new minimum-dissipation model for anisotropic grids is proposed. This anisotropic minimum-dissipation (AMD) model generalizes the desirable practical and theoretical properties of the QR model to anisotropic grids and does not require an approximation of the filter width. The AMD model is successfully applied in simulations of decaying grid turbulence on an isotropic grid and in simulations of a temporal mixing layer and turbulent channel flow on anisotropic grids.},

	abstract = {Coupled ice sheet–ocean models capable of simulating moving grounding lines are just becoming available. Such models have a broad range of potential applications in studying the dynamics of marine ice sheets and tidewater glaciers, from process studies to future projections of ice mass loss and sea level rise. The Marine Ice Sheet–Ocean Model Intercomparison Project (MISOMIP) is a community effort aimed at designing and coordinating a series of model intercomparison projects (MIPs) for model evaluation in idealized setups, model verification based on observations, and future projections for key regions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). Here we describe computational experiments constituting three interrelated MIPs for marine ice sheet models and regional ocean circulation models incorporating ice shelf cavities. These consist of ice sheet experiments under the Marine Ice Sheet MIP third phase (MISMIP+), ocean experiments under the Ice Shelf-Ocean MIP second phase (ISOMIP+) and coupled ice sheet–ocean experiments under the MISOMIP first phase (MISOMIP1). All three MIPs use a shared domain with idealized bedrock topography and forcing, allowing the coupled simulations (MISOMIP1) to be compared directly to the individual component simulations (MISMIP+ and ISOMIP+). The experiments, which have qualitative similarities to Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf and the adjacent region of the Amundsen Sea, are designed to explore the effects of changes in ocean conditions, specifically the temperature at depth, on basal melting and ice dynamics. In future work, differences between model results will form the basis for the evaluation of the participating models.},

The algorithm for the computation of density in terms of salinity, pressure, and conservative temperature produces errors in density and in the corresponding thermal expansion coefficient of the same order as errors for the density equation using potential temperature, both being twice as accurate as the International Equation of State when compared with Feistel’s new equation of state.

Their behavior is therefore closely linked to the mathematical description of the interaction between ice and ocean that is included in the code. An hierarchy of formulations that could be used to describe this interaction is presented. The main difference between them is the treatment of turbulent transfer within the oceanic boundary layer. The computed response to various levels of thermal driving and turbulent agitation in the mixed layer is discussed, as is the effect of various treatments of the conductive heat flux into the ice shelf. The performance of the different formulations that have been used in models of sub-ice-shelf circulation is assessed in comparison with observations of the turbulent heat flux beneath sea ice. Formulations that include an explicit parameterization of the oceanic boundary layer give results that lie within about 30\% of observation. Formulations that use constant bulk transfer coefficients entail a definite assumption about the level of turbulence in the water column and give melt/freeze rates that vary by a factor of 5, implying very different forcing on the respective ocean models.},

Such ice shelf water plumes may become supercooled and deposit marine ice if they rise (because of the pressure decrease in the in situ freezing temperature), so the model incorporates both melting and freezing at the ice shelf base and a multiple-size-class model of frazil ice dynamics and deposition. The plume is considered in two horizontal dimensions, so the influence of Coriolis forces is incorporated for the first time. It is found that rotation is extremely influential, with simulated plumes flowing in near-geostrophy because of the low friction at a smooth ice shelf base. As a result, an ice shelf water plume will only rise and become supercooled (and thus deposit marine ice) if it is constrained to flow upslope by topography. This result agrees with the observed distribution of marine ice under Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf, Antarctica. In addition, it is found that the model only produces reasonable marine ice formation rates when an accurate ice shelf draft is used, implying that the characteristics of real ice shelf water plumes can only be captured using models with both rotation and a realistic topography.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional ocean general circulation model is used to study the response of idealized ice shelves to a series of ocean-warming scenarios. The model predicts that the total ice shelf basal melt increases quadratically as the ocean offshore of the ice front warms. This occurs because the melt rate is proportional to the product of ocean flow speed and temperature in the mixed layer directly beneath the ice shelf, both of which are found to increase linearly with ocean warming. The behavior of this complex primitive equation model can be described surprisingly well with recourse to an idealized reduced system of equations, and it is shown that this system supports a melt rate response to warming that is generally quadratic in nature. This study confirms and unifies several previous examinations of the relation between melt rate and ocean temperature but disagrees with other results, particularly the claim that a single melt rate sensitivity to warming is universally valid. The hypothesized warming does not necessarily require a heat input to the ocean, as warmer waters (or larger volumes of “warm” water) may reach ice shelves purely through a shift in ocean circulation. Since ice shelves link the Antarctic Ice Sheet to the climate of the Southern Ocean, this finding of an above-linear rise in ice shelf mass loss as the ocean steadily warms is of significant importance to understanding ice sheet evolution and sea level rise.},

	abstract = {Tidal currents below the floating Ross Ice shelf are reconstructed by using a numerical tidal model. They are predominantly diurnal, achieve maximum strength in regions near where the ice shelf runs aground, and are significantly enhanced by topographic Rossby wave propagation along the ice front. A comparison with observations of the vertical motion of the ice shelf surface indicates that the model reproduces the diurnal tidal characteristics within 20\%. Similar agreement for the relatively weak semi-diurnal tides was not obtained, and this calls attention to possible errors of the open boundary forcing obtained from global-ocean tidal simulations and to possible errors in mapping zones of ice shelf grounding. Air-sea contact below the ice shelf is eliminated by the thick ice cover. The dominant sub-ice-shelf circulation may thus be tidally induced. A preliminary assessment of sub-ice-shelf conditions based on the numerical tidal simulations suggests that (1) strong barotropic circulation is driven along the ice front and (2) tidal fronts may form in the sub-ice-shelf cavity where the water column is thin and where the buoyancy input is weak.},

In the present work we perform direct numerical simulation of a turbulent open channel flow with a constant (cooling) heat flux imposed at the ground. This configuration provides a very simplified model for the surface layer at night. As a result of the ground cooling, the Reynolds stresses and the turbulent fluctuations near the ground re-adjust on times of the order of L/uτ, where L is the Obukhov length scale and uτis the friction velocity. For relatively weak cooling turbulence survives, but when \$\$\{Re\_L=Lu\_{\textbackslash}tau/{\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}lesssim 100\}\$\$turbulence collapses, a situation that is also observed in the ABL.

The model is a plane horizontally homogeneous channel flow, which is driven by a constant pressure gradient and which has a no-slip wall at the bottom and a free-slip wall at the top. At the lower wall a constant negative temperature flux is imposed. First, we consider a direct numerical simulation of the same channel flow. The simulation is computed with the neutral channel flow as initial condition and computed as a function of time for various values of the stability parameter h/L, where h is the channel height and L is related to the Obukhov length. We find that a turbulent solution is only possible for h/L {\textless} 1.25 and for larger values turbulence decays. Next, we consider a theoretical model for this channel flow based on a simple gradient transfer closure. The resulting equations allow an exact solution for the case of a stationary flow. The velocity profile for this solution is almost linear as a function of height in most of the channel. In the limit of infinite Reynolds number, the temperature profile has a logarithmic singularity at the upper wall of the channel. For the cases where a turbulent flow is maintained in the numerical simulation, we find that the velocity and temperature profiles are in good agreement with the results of the theoretical model when the effects of the surface layer on the exchange coefficients are taken into account.},

To this end a cooled, pressure-driven flow is investigated by means of a local similarity model. Simulations reveal a temporary collapse of turbulence whenever the surface heat extraction, expressed in its nondimensional form {\textless}em{\textgreater}h{\textless}/em{\textgreater}/{\textless}em{\textgreater}L{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, exceeds a critical value. As any temporary reduction of turbulent friction is followed by flow acceleration, the long-term state is unconditionally turbulent. In contrast, the temporary cessation of turbulence, which may actually last for several hours in the nocturnal boundary layer, can be understood from the fact that the time scale for boundary layer diffusion is much smaller than the time scale for flow acceleration. This limits the available momentum that can be used for downward heat transport. In case the surface heat extraction exceeds the so-called maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF), the near-surface inversion rapidly increases. Finally, turbulent activity is largely suppressed by the intense density stratification that supports the emergence of a different, calmer boundary layer regime.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The collapse of turbulence in a pressure-driven, cooled channel flow is studied by using 3D direct numerical simulations (DNS) in combination with theoretical analysis using a local similarity model. Previous studies with DNS reported a definite collapse of turbulence in cases when the normalized surface cooling h/L (with h the channel depth and L the Obukhov length) exceeded a value of 0.5. A recent study by the present authors succeeded in explaining this collapse using the so-called maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF) theory. This states that collapse may occur when the ambient momentum of the flow is too weak to transport enough heat downward to compensate for the surface cooling. The MSHF theory predicts that, in pressure-driven flows, acceleration of the fluid after collapse will eventually cause a regeneration of turbulence, in contrast with the aforementioned DNS results. It also predicts that the flow should be able to survive ‘supercritical’ cooling rates, in cases when sufficient momentum is applied to the initial state. Here, both predictions are confirmed using DNS simulations. It is also shown that in DNS a recovery of turbulence will occur naturally, provided that perturbations of finite amplitude are imposed on the laminarized state and provided that sufficient time for flow acceleration is allowed. As such, we conclude that the collapse of turbulence in this configuration is a temporary, transient phenomenon for which a universal cooling rate does not exist. Finally, in the present work a one-to-one comparison between a parametrized, local similarity model and the turbulence-resolving model (DNS) is made. Although local similarity originates from observations that represent much larger Reynolds numbers than those covered by our DNS simulations, both methods appear to predict very similar mean velocity (and temperature) profiles. This suggests that in-depth analysis with DNS can be an attractive complementary tool with which to study atmospheric physics, in addition to tools that are able to represent high Reynolds number flows like large-eddy simulations.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a stable atmospheric boundary layer is performed using recently developed dynamic subgrid-scale (SGS) models. These models not only calculate the Smagorinsky coefficient and SGS Prandtl number dynamically based on the smallest resolved motions in the flow, they also allow for scale dependence of those coefficients. This dynamic calculation requires statistical averaging for numerical stability. Here, we evaluate three commonly used averaging schemes in stable atmospheric boundary-layer simulations: averaging over horizontal planes, over adjacent grid points, and following fluid particle trajectories. Particular attention is focused on assessing the effect of the different averaging methods on resolved flow statistics and SGS model coefficients. Our results indicate that averaging schemes that allow the coefficients to fluctuate locally give results that are in better agreement with boundary-layer similarity theory and previous LES studies. Even among models that are local, the averaging method is found to affect model coefficient probability density function distributions and turbulent spectra of the resolved velocity and temperature fields. Overall, averaging along fluid pathlines is found to produce the best combination of self consistent model coefficients, first- and second-order flow statistics and insensitivity to grid resolution.},

Hot-water drilled access holes were made during January 1999, allowing conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiling and the deployment of instrument moorings. The CTD profiles show that the entire water column is below the surface freezing point. We estimate the (summer) flux of water between the two sites to be 2×106 m3 s−1. The summer potential temperature-salinity properties of the water column suggest that this flow is part of a recirculation in the deepest part of the subice shelf cavity and the Filchner Depression. The recirculation is driven by a combination of the melting of deep basal ice and the freezing that results from the depressurization of the cold buoyant water as it ascends the ice shelf base. The source of the water was high-salinity shelf water (HSSW) produced in the Ronne Depression. This is the water that provides the external heat necessary for the strong melting at the deep grounding lines in the vicinity of Foundation Ice Stream. Instruments moored at the drill sites show that during the winter HSSW formed on the Berkner Shelf flows beneath the ice shelf and largely displaces the recirculating water from the two sites. This provides an externally driven through flow that is warmer (nearer the surface freezing point) and slower than the internal recirculation and which is low enough in density to escape the Filchner Depression.},

Direct observations of the ice shelf-ocean interaction are extremely scarce and in many regions melt rates from ice shelf-ocean models are not constrained by measurements. Our two years of data (2010 and 2011) from three oceanic moorings below the Fimbul Ice Shelf in the Eastern Weddell Sea show cold cavity waters, with average temperatures of less than 0.1°C above the surface freezing point. This suggests low basal melt rates, consistent with remote sensing-based, steady-state mass balance estimates for this sector of the Antarctic coast. Oceanic heat for basal melting is found to be supplied by two sources of warm water entering below the ice: (i) eddy-like bursts of Modified Warm Deep Water that access the cavity at depth for eight months of the record; and (ii) fresh surface water that flushes parts of the ice base with temperatures above freezing during late summer and fall. This interplay of processes implies that basal melting at the Fimbul Ice Shelf cannot simply be parameterized by coastal deep ocean temperatures, but instead appears directly linked to both solar forcing at the surface as well as to the dynamics of the coastal current system.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamic ablation of ice in contact with the ocean is an essential element of ice sheet and ocean interactions but is challenging to model and quantify. Building on earlier observations of sea ice ablation, a variety of recent theoretical, experimental and observational studies have considered ice ablation in contrasting geometries, from vertical to near-horizontal ice faces, and reveal different scaling behaviour for predicted ablation rates in different dynamical regimes. However, uncertainties remain about when the contrasting results should be applied, as existing model parameterisations do not capture all relevant regimes of ice-ocean ablation. To progress towards improved models of ice-ocean interaction, we synthesise current understanding into a classification of ablation types. We examine the effect of the classification on the parameterisation of turbulent fluxes from the ocean towards the ice, and identify the dominant processes next to ice interfaces of different orientation. Four ablation types are defined: melting and dissolving based on ocean temperatures, and shear-controlled and buoyancy-controlled regimes based on the dynamics of the near-ice molecular sublayer. We describe existing observational and modelling studies of sea ice, ice shelves, and glacier termini, as well as laboratory studies, to show how they fit into this classification. Two sets of observations from the Ross and Ronne Ice Shelf cavities suggest that both the buoyancy-controlled and shear-controlled regimes may be relevant under different oceanographic conditions. Overall, buoyancy-controlled dynamics are more likely when the molecular sublayer has lower Reynolds number, and shear for higher Reynolds number, although the observations suggest some variability about this trend.},

Including tidal forcing causes a significant intensification in the sub-ice shelf circulation, with an increase in melting (3-fold) and refreezing (6-fold); the net melt rate and seawater flux through the cavity approximately doubles. With tidal forcing, the spatial pattern and magnitude of basal melting and freezing generally match observations. The 0.22 m a−1 net melt rate is close to satellite-derived estimates and at the lower end of oceanographic values. The Ice Shelf Water outflow mixes with shelf waters, forming a cold ({\textless}−1.9°C), dense overflow (0.83 Sv) that spills down the continental slope.

A one-dimensional turbulence closure ocean model has been applied to this high latitude sub-ice-shelf environment to demonstrate that tidal currents mix HSSW vertically through the water column and cause melting at the bottom of the ice shelf. Significantly FRIS lies near the critical latitude for the semidiurnal tide, where the Coriolis frequency equals the tidal frequency, resulting in a strongly depth-dependent tidal current and thick boundary layers. Using the model, the effect of the critical latitude, stratification, and the polarization of the tidal current ellipse on boundary layer structure and subsequent vertical mixing are examined. The model shows that stratification significantly affects how the shape of the tidal current ellipse varies with depth and that both the depth to which the pycnocline initially develops and the longer term melt rates are highly dependent on tidal current ellipse polarization. The sensitivity to both the stratification and the polarization are due, in large part, to the proximity of the critical latitude. Positive polarizations (anticlockwise rotating current vectors) quickly develop deeper pycnoclines and maintain higher melt rates than negative polarizations (clockwise rotating current vectors). For many areas beneath FRIS the polarization ranges from −0.3 to +0.3; here the modeled pycnocline development is sensitive to polarization, though the effect on the time-averaged melt rate is suppressed for positive polarizations. However, in key areas where the polarization exceeds ±0.3 and the ellipses are more open and circular, the effects of polarization are significant. Levels of tidal mixing and associated melting vary by more than an order of magnitude over the whole tidal ellipse polarization range, showing that very different mixing and melting regimes are present beneath FRIS.},

	abstract = {Recent modeling studies of ocean circulation in the southern Weddell Sea, Antarctica, project an increase over this century of ocean heat into the cavity beneath Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS). This increase in ocean heat would lead to more basal melting and a modification of the FRIS ice draft. The corresponding change in cavity shape will affect advective pathways and the spatial distribution of tidal currents, which play important roles in basal melting under FRIS. These feedbacks between heat flux, basal melting, and tides will affect the evolution of FRIS under the influence of a changing climate. We explore these feedbacks with a three-dimensional ocean model of the southern Weddell Sea that is forced by thermodynamic exchange beneath the ice shelf and tides along the open boundaries. Our results show regionally dependent feedbacks that, in some areas, substantially modify the melt rates near the grounding lines of buttressed ice streams that flow into FRIS. These feedbacks are introduced by variations in meltwater production as well as the circulation of this meltwater within the FRIS cavity; they are influenced locally by sensitivity of tidal currents to water column thickness (wct) and non-locally by changes in circulation pathways that transport an integrated history of mixing and meltwater entrainment along flow paths. Our results highlight the importance of including explicit tidal forcing in models of future mass loss from FRIS and from the adjacent grounded ice sheet as individual ice-stream grounding zones experience different responses to warming of the ocean inflow.},

While much research attention is paid to larger ice shelves and those experiencing the most rapid change, many smaller, unstudied ice shelves offer valuable insights. Here, we investigate the oceanographic conditions and melting beneath the Sørsdal ice shelf, East Antarctica. We present results from the 2018/2019 Sørsdal deployment of the University of Tasmania's autonomous underwater vehicle nupiri muka. Oceanography adjacent to and beneath the ice shelf front shows a cold and relatively saline environment dominated by Winter Water and Dense Shelf Water, while bathymetry measurements show a deep (∼1,200 m) trough running into the ice shelf cavity. Two multiyear deployments of Autonomous Phase-sensitive Radar Echo Sounders on the surface of the ice shelf show weak melt rates (average of 1.6 and 2.3 m yr−1) with low temporal variability. These observations are supported by numerical ocean model and satellite estimates of melting. We speculate that the presence of a ∼825 m thick (350 m to at least 1,175 m) homogeneous layer of cold, dense water blocks access from warmer waters that intrude into Prydz Bay from offshore, resulting in weak melt rates. However, the newly identified trough means that the ice shelf is vulnerable to any decrease in polynya activity that allows warm water to enter the cavity. This could lead to increased basal melting and mass loss through this sector of Antarctica.},

Thepresent experiment is a continuation of the workcarried out in a wind tunnel at Colorado StateUniversity (CSU), where the SBL flows were developed over asmooth surface. Stably stratified flows were createdby heating the wind-tunnel airflow to a temperature ofabout 40–50°and by cooling the test-section floor toa temperature of about 10°. To simulate therough surface, a chain roughness was placed over thetest-section floor. We have investigated the buoyancyeffect on the turbulent boundary layer developed overthis rough surface for a wide range of stability,particularly focusing on the turbulence structure andtransport process in the very stable boundary layer.The present experimental results broadly confirm theresults obtained in the CSU experiment with the smoothsurface, and emphasizes the following features: thevertical profiles of turbulence statistics exhibitdifferent behaviour in two distinct stability regimes with weak and strong stability,corresponding to the difference in the verticalprofiles of the local Richardson number. The tworegimes are separated by the critical Richardsonnumber. The magnitudes in turbulence intensities andturbulent fluxes for the weak stability regime aremuch greater than those of the CSU experiments becauseof the greater surface roughness. For the very stableboundary layer, the turbulent fluxes of momentum andheat tend to vanish and wave-like motions due to theKelvin–Helmholtz instability and the rolling up andbreaking of those waves can be observed. Furthermore,the appearance of internal gravity waves is suggestedfrom cross-spectrum analyses.},

This study uses small-scale, high-resolution, 3D numerical simulations to model an idealized boundary layer beneath a melting ice shelf to investigate the influence of ambient turbulence on double-diffusive convection (i.e., convection driven by the difference in diffusivities between salinity and temperature). Isotropic turbulence is forced throughout the simulations and the temperature and salinity are initialized with homogeneous values similar to observations. The initial temperature and the strength of forced turbulence are varied as controlling parameters within an oceanographically relevant parameter space. Two contrasting regimes are identified. In one regime double-diffusive convection dominates, and in the other convection is inhibited by the forced turbulence. The convective regime occurs for high temperatures and low turbulence levels, where it is long lived and affects the flow, melt rate, and melt pattern. A criterion for identifying convection in terms of the temperature and salinity profiles, and the turbulent dissipation rate, is proposed. This criterion may be applied to observations and theoretical models to quantify the effect of double-diffusive convection on ice shelf melt rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Simultaneous single-point measurements of the mean and fluctuating density and longitudinal and vertical velocities were made over a wide range of downstream positions. For strong stability, i.e. a mean gradient Richardson number Ri greater than a critical value of Ricr ≈ 0.25, there is no observed growth of turbulence and the buoyancy effects are similar to those in the unsheared experiments of Stillinger, Helland \& Van Atta (1983) and Itsweire, Helland \& Van Atta (1986). For values of Richardson number less than Ricr the turbulence grows at a rate depending on Ri and for large evolution times the ratio between the Ozmidov and turbulent lengthscale approaches a constant value which is also a function of Richardson number.Normalized velocity and density power spectra for the present experiments conform to normalized spectra from previous moderate- to high-Reynolds-number studies. With increasing \${\textbackslash}tau = (x/{\textbackslash}overline\{U\}) ({\textbackslash}partial	{\textbackslash}overline\{U\}/{\textbackslash}partial z)\$ or decreasing stability, the stratified shear spectra exhibit greater portions of the universal non-stratified spectrum curve.

	abstract = {Boundary-forced stratified turbulence is studied in the prototypical case of turbulent 
channel flow subject to stable stratification. The large-eddy simulation approach is 
used with a mixed subgrid model that involves a dynamic eddy viscosity component 
and a scale-similarity component. After an initial transient, the flow reaches a new 
balanced state corresponding to active wall-bounded turbulence with reduced vertical 
transport which, for the cases in our study with moderate-to-large levels of stratification, 
coexists with internal wave activity in the core of the channel. A systematic 
reduction of turbulence levels, density fluctuations and associated vertical transport 
with increasing stratification is observed. Countergradient buoyancy flux is observed 
in the outer region for sufficiently high stratification.
            Mixing of the density field in stratified channel flow results from turbulent events 
generated near the boundaries that couple with the outer, more stable flow. The 
vertical density structure is thus of interest for analogous boundary-forced mixing 
situations in geophysical flows. It is found that, with increasing stratification, the 
mean density profile becomes sharper in the central region between the two turbulent 
layers at the upper and lower walls, similar to observations in field measurements as 
well as laboratory experiments with analogous density-mixing situations.
            
              Channel flow is strongly inhomogeneous with alternative choices for the Richardson 
number. In spite of these complications, the gradient Richardson number,
              Ri
              
                g
              
              , appears 
to be the important local determinant of buoyancy effects. All simulated cases show 
that correlation coefficients associated with vertical transport collapse from their nominal unstratified 
values over a narrow range, 0.15 {\textless}
              Ri
              
                g
              
              {\textless} 0.25. The vertical turbulent 
Froude number,
              Fr
              
                w
              
              , has an
              O
              (1) value across most of the channel. It 
is remarkable that stratified channel flow, with such a large variation of overall 
density difference (factor of 26) between cases, shows a relatively universal behaviour 
of correlation coefficients and vertical Froude number when plotted as a function of
              Ri
              
                g
              
              . The visualizations show wavy motion in the core region where the gradient

                g
              
              , is large and low-speed streaks in the near-wall region, 
typical of unstratified channel flow, where

                g
              
              is small. It appears from the 
visualizations that, with increasing stratification, the region with wavy motion progressively encroaches 
into the zone with active turbulence; the location of

We review recent work on the turbulence transition in stratified parallel flows that demonstrates that this value is not only numerically predictable but also that it is expected to be a nonmonotonic function of the Richardson number that characterizes preturbulent stratification strength. This value of the mixing efficiency appears to be characteristic of the late-time behavior of the turbulent flow that develops after an initially laminar shear flow has undergone the transition to turbulence through an intermediate instability of Kelvin-Helmholtz type.},

	abstract = {A theory for momentum flux in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) stabilized by continuous surface buoyancy is extended to include turbulent flux of an arbitrary scalar contaminant and then used to estimate how wind-driven sea ice melts as it encounters temperatures in the oceanic boundary layer that are above the melting point. Given wind stress and temperature difference Δθ across the oceanic PBL, the theory predicts melt rate and ice drift velocity. Results indicate that the effect of buoyancy on PBL turbulence is significant even with small values of Δθ({\textless}0.5 K). Curves of melt rate and ice speed as functions of u*, the interfacial friction velocity, show that melting is strongly dependent on stress at the interface and that the effective drag on the ice undersurface is significantly reduced at oceanic temperatures commonly observed in the marginal ice zone. The latter suggests that divergence will occur at the ice margin when off-ice winds advect the pack over water above the melting temperature. The structure of mean currents beneath the ice is also investigated; results indicate that advection will play an important, if not dominant, role in determining water column properties near an ice edge front.},

	abstract = {Turbulence data from three Arctic drift station experiments demonstrate features of turbulent heat transfer in the oceanic boundary layer. Time series analysis of several w′T′ records shows that heat and momentum flux occur at nearly the same scales, typically by turbulent eddies of the order of 10–20 m in horizontal extent and a few meters in vertical extent. Probability distribution functions of w′T′ have large skewness and kurtosis, where the latter confirms that most of the flux occurs in intermittent “events” with positive and negative excursions an order of magnitude larger than the mean value. An estimate of the eddy heat diffusivity in the outer (Ekman) part of the boundary layer, based on measured heat flux and temperature gradient during a diurnal tidal cycle over the Yermak Plateau slope north of Fram Strait, agrees reasonably well with the eddy viscosity, with values as high as 0.15 m2 s−1. An analysis of measurements made near the ice-ocean interface at the three stations shows that heat flux increases with both temperature elevation above freezing and with friction velocity at the interface. It also reveals a surprising uniformity in parameters describing the heat and mass transfer: e.g., the thickness of the “transition sublayer” (from a modified version of the Yaglom-Kader theory) is about 10 cm at all three sites, despite nearly a fivefold difference in the under-ice roughness z0, which ranges from approximately 2 to 9 cm. A much simplified model for heat and mass transfer at the ice-ocean interface, suggested by the relative uniformity of the heat transfer coefficients at the three sites, is outlined.},

	abstract = {Properly describing heat and salt flux at the ice/ocean interface is essential for understanding and modeling the energy and mass balance of drifting sea ice. Basal growth or ablation depends on the ratio, R, of the interface heat exchange coefficient to that of salt, such that as R increases so does the rate-limiting impact of salt diffusion. Observations of relatively slow melt rates in above freezing seawater (plus migration of summer “false bottoms”) suggest by analogy with laboratory studies that double diffusion of heat and salt from the ocean is important during the melting process, with numeric values for R estimated to range from 35 to 70. If the same double-diffusive principles apply for ice growth as for melting (i.e., if the process is symmetric), supercooling (possibly relieved by frazil crystal production) would occur under rapidly growing ice, yet neither extensive supercooling nor frazil accumulation is found in Arctic pack ice with limited atmospheric contact. Physical properties and turbulent fluxes of heat and salt were measured in the relatively controlled setting of a tidally driven Svalbard fjord, under growing fast ice in late winter. The data failed to show supercooling, frazil production, or enhanced heat flux, suggesting that the double diffusive process is asymmetric. Modeling results compared with measured turbulent fluxes imply that R = 1 when ice freezes; i.e., that double-diffusive tendencies are relieved at or above the immediate interface. An algorithm for calculating ice/ocean heat and salt flux accommodating the different processes is presented, along with recommended ranges for the interface exchange coefficients.},

	abstract = {Ocean-forced basal melting has been implicated in the widespread thinning of Antarctic ice shelves, but an understanding of what determines melt rates is hampered by limited knowledge of the buoyancy- and frictionally controlled flows along the ice shelf base that regulate heat transfer from ocean to ice. In an attempt to address this deficiency, a simple model of a buoyant boundary flow, considering only the spatial dimension perpendicular to the boundary, is presented. Results indicate that two possible flow regimes exist: a weakly stratified, geostrophic cross-slope current with upslope flow within a buoyant Ekman layer or a strongly stratified, upslope current with a weak cross-slope flow. The latter regime, which is analogous to the steady solution for a katabatic wind, is most appropriate when the ice–ocean interface is steep. For the gentle slopes typical of Antarctic ice shelves, the buoyant Ekman regime, which has similarities with the case of an unstratified density current on a slope, provides some useful insight. When combined with a background flow, a range of possible near-ice current profiles emerge as a result of arrest or enhancement of the upslope Ekman transport. A simple expression for the upslope transport can be formed that is analogous to that for the wind-forced surface Ekman layer, with curvature of the ice shelf base replacing the wind stress curl in driving exchange between the Ekman layer and the geostrophic current below.},

Understanding how those competing effects influence the dynamical stability of the boundary current is the key to quantifying the turbulent transfer of heat from far-field ocean to ice. The implications of the close coupling between shear, stability and mixing are explored with the aid of a one-dimensional numerical model that simulates density and current profiles perpendicular to the ice. Diffusivity and viscosity are determined using a mixing length model within the turbulent boundary layer and empirical functions of the gradient Richardson number in the stratified layer below. Starting from rest, the boundary current is initially strongly stratified and dynamically stable, slowly thickening as meltwater diffuses away from the interface. Eventually, the current enters a second phase where dynamical instability generates a relatively well-mixed, turbulent layer adjacent to the ice, while beneath the current maximum, strong stratification suppresses mixing in the region of reverse shear. Under weak buoyancy forcing the timescale for development of the initial dynamical instability can be months or longer, but background flows, which are always present in reality, provide additional current shear that greatly accelerates the process. A third phase can be reached when the ice shelf base is sufficiently steep, with dynamical instability extending beyond the boundary layer into regions of geostrophic flow, generating a marginally-stable pycnocline through which the heat flux is a simple function of ice-ocean interfacial slope.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Upper boundary conditions for numerical models of the ocean are conventionally formulated under the premise that the boundary is a material surface. In the presence of an ice cover, such an assumption can lead to nonconservative equations for temperature, salinity, and other tracers. The problem arises because conditions at the ice–ocean interface differ from those in the water beneath. Advection of water with interfacial properties into the interior of the ocean therefore constitutes a tracer flux, neglect of which induces a drift in concentration that is most rapid for those tracers having the lowest diffusivities. If tracers are to be correctly conserved, either the kinematic boundary condition must explicitly allow advection across the interface, or the flux boundary condition must parameterize the effects of both vertical advection and diffusion in the boundary layer. In practice, the latter alternative is often implemented, although this is rarely done for all tracers.},

 on the heat and momentum fluxes across the channel gap and on the mean temperature and velocity profile are observed. These effects can be described through a mixing length model coupling Monin–Obukhov (M–O) similarity theory and van Driest damping functions. We then employ M–O theory to formulate similarity scalings for various flow diagnostics for the stratified turbulence in the gap interior. The midchannel gap gradient Richardson number 




RigRi\_\{g\}



 is determined by the length scale ratio 




h/Lh/L



, where 




hh



 is the half-channel gap depth and 




LL



 is the Obukhov length scale. As 




h/Lh/L



 approaches very large values,

 asymptotes to a maximum characteristic value of approximately 0.2. The buoyancy Reynolds number

 is the near-wall viscous scale. The flux Richardson number

, where

 are the turbulent viscosity and diffusivity respectively, which is consistent with Reynolds analogy. The turbulent Froude number

. The classical Osborn model based on turbulent kinetic energy balance in statistically stationary stratified sheared turbulence (Osborn, J. Phys. Oceanogr., vol. 10, 1980, pp. 83–89), together with M–O scalings, results in a parameterization of

. With this parameterization validated through direct numerical simulation data, we provide physical interpretations of these results in the context of M–O similarity theory. These results are also discussed and rationalized with respect to other parameterizations in the literature. This paper demonstrates the role of M–O similarity in setting the mixing efficiency of equilibrated constant-flux layers, and the effects of Prandtl number on mixing in wall-bounded stratified turbulent flows.},

This fact compells us to work on modifications to the subgrid turbulence schemes, although there is not any widely accepted theory on anisotropic turbulence. In this work, a LES model is used to see what range of stable stratification can still be simulated with a subgrid turbulence scheme using the Kolmogorov theory for the dissipation. Twenty simulations of increasing stability have been performed using a horizontal resolution of 5 m. The model is able to simulate weakly and moderately stable conditions and experiences runaway cooling for strong stability. The goodness of the successful simulations is inspected through comparison to observations from the experimental campaigns SABLES-98 and CASES-99. Other supplementary tests have been performed on the resolution and the surface boundary condition.},

	abstract = {A depth-averaged tidal model has been applied to the southern Weddell Sea. The model domain covers the southern continental shelf, including the ocean cavity beneath Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf. Reasonable agreement with the available current meter data has been achieved. Our results confirm that in areas with shallow water and large topographic gradients, tidal oscillations with peak velocities up to 1 m s−1 play a significant role in the vertical mixing and transport of water masses. The estimated energy dissipation beneath Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf due to surface friction is 25 GW, approximately 1\% of the world's total tidal dissipation. Tidally induced Lagrangian residual currents converging at the ice front, an area of strong mixing, draw together water masses from the continental shelf and sub-ice shelf cavity. The model indicates that Lagrangian residual currents have fluxes of up to 250,000 m3 s−1, and speeds of over 5 cm s−1 along the ice front, with over 350,000 m3 s−1 being exchanged between the sub-ice shelf cavity and adjacent continental shelf. These currents are particularly efficient in ventilating the sub-ice shelf cavity within 150 km of Ronne Ice Front. Such strong tidal mixing will significantly modify the properties of water masses that flow through this region, particularly to the west of Berkner Island. The model predictions indicate that tidal processes strongly influence the oceanographic conditions in the vicinity of Ronne Ice Front. Shipborne observations along the ice front support many of the model predictions concerning the effect of tides on the hydrography.},

Special attention is paid to accurate treatment of internal dissipation and to formulation of an upper boundary region and lateral boundary conditions which allow upward and lateral propagation of wave energy out of the model. The model is hydrostatic and uses potential temperature for the vertical coordinate. A local adjustment procedure is derived to parameterize low Richardson number instability. The model behavior is tested against analytic theory and then applied to a variety of idealized and real flow situations, leading to some new insights and new questions on the nature of large-amplitude mountain waves. The model proves to be effective in simulating the structure of two observed cases of strong mountain waves with very different characteristics.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},
